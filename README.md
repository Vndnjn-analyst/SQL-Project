I worked on SQL based project for my Business Intelligence coursework. This project involved developing SQL queries to extract business insights from the historical sales data of a Bicycle manufacturer. The task was to study the performance of new retail line of business started by the predominantly wholesale focused business. The analysis also needed to bring out any visible signs of cannibalization. The data was stored in different tables namely orders, clients, products, etc. I needed to join the different tables to get an aggregate view of the yearly sales data for both retail and wholesale businesses. I made use of concepts such as partitions, window functions and temporary tables to summarize data based on product categories. I compared the sales trends by product categories to study cannibalization. After this analysis, I was able to conclude that their retail business was taking off with sales increasing. This, however, didnâ€™t seem to impact their wholesale sales. I was also able to narrow down a few product models which were performing better on the retail platform.
